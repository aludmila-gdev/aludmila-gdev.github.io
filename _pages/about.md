I have been working as a technologist for over 13 years, most of that time as a software quality specialist.

Over the past years, I've shifted my career focus to working with mobile apps, mainly working on Android using Kotlin.

Creator and maintainer of the Kranberry library, aimed at making end-to-end writing tests for Android apps more productive.

An active person in the local community, passionate about building and applying knowledge collectively and creatively!
