an introduction to the software that will be covered, explaining its features and functionality.

## Prerequisites
In this section, I share with you the configuration of my computer, and I consider the list of what are the minimum requirements necessary for you to follow the tutorial.

|        MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014)        |
|:-----------------------------------------------------:|

|               Memory 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3               |
|              Graphics Intel Iris 1536 MB              |


However, it's ok if you have a different hardware configuration! Try to follow the steps and adapt them to your context!

## Blockquotes

Single line blockquote:

> Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:

> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.

<cite>Steve Jobs</cite> --- Apple Worldwide Developers' Conference, 1997
