## Testing the environment

### Clone a test project

After setting up your ssh keys, you should be able to clone a test repository to build an Android project. To do this, run the following command in your iterm:
```sh
 git clone git@github.com:aludmila-gdev/DiceRoller.git
```
If there is an error at this stage, you can search for an answer on Google, or contact me by sending the error message, and I can try to help you in some way!

### Open and run the test project

Now that the initial configurations are done, let's test them by building a pre-existing project, which was downloaded from git in the previous step.

1. Open Android Studio, and you should see a screen like this:
   {% include figure image_path="assets/images/home-android-studio.png" alt="" caption="" %}

2. Open the project you downloaded earlier:

   {% include figure image_path="assets/images/open-project.png" alt="" caption="" %}

3. [Create a virtual device] following the guideline;

4. Once you have a device created, use the play icon to build and view the app in the emulator:

   {% include figure image_path="assets/images/play-app.png" alt="" caption="" %}

5. Wait for the app to build, this may take a few minutes. At the end you should see a screen similar to this:

   {% include figure image_path="assets/images/environment-working.png" alt="" caption="" %}

6. Congratulations!! you have a completely configured android environment, and now you can start building your apps!ðŸ¥³
